#  Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection

This project demonstrates how to use the **Isolation Forest** algorithm to detect anomalies in a dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

---

##  What is Isolation Forest?

Isolation Forest is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for **anomaly detection**. It works by isolating observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature.

- Anomalies are more susceptible to isolation and require fewer splits to isolate.
- It is particularly effective for **high-dimensional datasets**.
- It is efficient and scalable to large datasets.

##  How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook IsolationForest.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells step-by-step to:

  - [ ] Load the dataset
  
  - [ ] Fit the Isolation Forest model
  
  - [ ] Detect anomalies
  
  - [ ] Visualize results

## Example Output
The model assigns an anomaly score to each point, and classifies them as either:

1 ‚Üí Normal

-1 ‚Üí Anomaly

You can visualize the anomalies using a scatter plot or other graphs provided in the notebook.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization
You can easily adapt the notebook for your own dataset by replacing the CSV file and adjusting:

Number of estimators (n_estimators)

Contamination rate (contamination)

Feature selection or scaling

## Use Cases
Fraud detection (e.g. credit card transactions)

Network intrusion detection

Fault detection in equipment

Outlier detection in sensor data
